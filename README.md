# Database_Simulator
 A very bad and non-real representation of how databases are created. Also its written in Python.

# Usage 
 Change the credentials to yours in the script where the email has been setted up.

# Challenge
 In the database folder there is a example file and in their is a hash. Try to brute force this hash. (You might find something about me) Hint: It's a 5 letter word from english language and no numbers.
